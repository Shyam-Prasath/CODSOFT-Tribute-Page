      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (July 18, 1918 – December 5, 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary,
        political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's
        first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His presidency
        marked the end of decades of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa. Mandela is
        widely regarded as an icon of peace and reconciliation.

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Mandela was born in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province, to the Thembu royal family.
        After studying law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand, he worked as a lawyer in Johannesburg.
        There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the African National Congress (ANC) in 1943
        and co-founding its Youth League in 1944.

      <h2>Political Career</h2>
      <p>
        After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid—a system of racial segregation that privileged whites—Mandela
        and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence
        for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities
        and, with the ANC leadership, was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial.
